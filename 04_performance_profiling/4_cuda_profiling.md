###  Tips for Tool Usage

-  **Start with Nsight Systems** to find **where** bottlenecks occur (e.g. CPU wait time, GPU idle).
-  Use **Nsight Compute** to find **why** a kernel is underperforming (e.g. low occupancy, warp divergence).
-  Always run **cuda-memcheck** before tuning for performance — correctness comes first.
-  Use **cuda-gdb** to diagnose crashes or logic errors in device code when print-style debugging fails.



## 2.  Nsight Systems – Timeline Debugging

`Nsight Systems` provides a **top-down, system-wide view** of your application. It captures CPU, GPU, memory, and OS interactions in a **timeline-based UI**, making it ideal for analyzing bottlenecks related to synchronization, concurrency, and data transfers.


###  Use Cases

-  **Stream Concurrency**
  Visualize how multiple CUDA streams overlap. Helps you confirm whether your compute and memory operations run in parallel or serialize unnecessarily.

-  **Serialization Detection**
  Detect if memory copies and kernels are serialized on the same stream due to dependencies or poor stream usage.

-  **CPU–GPU Sync Bottlenecks**
  Identify `cudaMemcpy` or `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` calls that block CPU threads while waiting on the GPU. Look for gaps between kernel launches and compute.

-  **Multi-GPU Workload Analysis**
  Evaluate load balancing across GPUs in multi-GPU systems. See whether each GPU is fully utilized and identify synchronization overhead.


###  Key Metrics & Events

| Metric/Event             | What It Tells You                                                    |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Kernel Launch Time**    | When and how long each kernel runs. Look for launch delays.          |
| **Memcpy Overlap**        | Whether memory transfers overlap with computation (for async copies).|
| **Host Thread Blocking**  | CPU-side stalls due to synchronization or memory transfers.          |
| **Stream Usage Timeline** | Which streams are active/inactive and how they overlap.              |
| **CPU–GPU Correlation**   | Track dependencies between CPU launches and GPU execution.           |
| **NVTX Markers**          | Annotate timeline with custom labels (e.g. per frame, phase, step).  |


###  Best Practices

- Use **CUDA events and NVTX ranges** to annotate key sections of your code. This enhances timeline readability and correlates logical phases with low-level execution.

- Confirm that memory transfers (e.g. `cudaMemcpyAsync`) and kernel executions on different streams **overlap as expected**.

- Check for long **idle gaps** between GPU operations — this usually signals a CPU bottleneck or missing prefetching/synchronization error.


###  Example Workflow

1. Launch your application with:
```bash
nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt ./my_app
```

## 3.  Nsight Compute – Kernel Performance

`Nsight Compute` is NVIDIA's low-level, per-kernel profiler. It provides **fine-grained performance metrics** that reveal how your CUDA kernel behaves at the microarchitectural level.

You can analyze memory throughput, warp execution efficiency, cache utilization, instruction mix, and more — all specific to a single kernel launch.


###  Why Use Nsight Compute?

- Drill down into individual kernels that appear slow in Nsight Systems.
- Identify causes of low throughput: memory issues, control flow divergence, register pressure.
- Validate optimization strategies by comparing metrics pre/post changes.


###  Key Metrics and What They Reveal

| Metric                        | Insight                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SM Efficiency**             | The percentage of time at least one warp was active on the SM. <br> **High values (80–100%)** indicate good GPU utilization.<br> **Low values** suggest idle SMs due to under-filled warps or excessive waiting. |
| **Occupancy**                 | Ratio of active warps to the max possible on an SM.<br> Helps hide memory latency.<br> Low occupancy may point to too many registers or shared memory usage. |
| **Warp Execution Efficiency** | Percentage of threads in a warp that are active.<br> Close to 100% = uniform execution.<br> Lower values indicate warp divergence (e.g., `if/else`, loop branching). |
| **Global Load Efficiency**    | Measures how well memory loads are coalesced and aligned.<br> High efficiency means consecutive threads access consecutive memory locations.<br> Poor efficiency leads to increased memory transactions and latency. |
| **L2 Cache Hit Rate**         | Indicates whether memory accesses benefit from caching.<br> High hit rate = good data reuse.<br> Low hit rate = working set is too large or poorly localized. |


###  Additional Useful Metrics

| Metric                  | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DRAM Throughput**      | Total bandwidth usage – helps determine if the kernel is memory-bound.     |
| **Achieved Occupancy**   | Actual number of warps running compared to theoretical max.                |
| **Issue Slot Utilization**| Measures how often instruction issue slots are used – reflects ILP.       |
| **Branch Efficiency**     | Fraction of non-divergent branches in warp execution.                     |
| **Stall Reasons**         | Categorizes time lost to memory dependency, execution dependency, etc.    |

###  How to Use Nsight Compute

1. Launch profiling:
```bash
ncu --set full --target-processes all ./my_app
```

## 4.  Roofline Model

The **Roofline Model** is a visual and conceptual tool that helps you understand the performance limits of your CUDA kernel based on **compute throughput vs. memory bandwidth**.

It shows whether your kernel is:
- **Memory-bound**: Limited by how fast data can be moved from memory (DRAM or cache) to compute units.
- **Compute-bound**: Limited by how fast arithmetic instructions can be executed by the SMs.


###  Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FLOP/s**             | Floating-point operations per second – a measure of computational intensity |
| **Operational Intensity (OI)** | Ratio of FLOPs to bytes accessed (FLOPs / Byte)                        |
| **Bandwidth Ceiling**  | The maximum memory bandwidth of the GPU (e.g., 1.6 TB/s on H100)             |
| **Compute Roofline**   | The theoretical peak compute throughput (e.g., 60 TFLOP/s FP32)              |

The intersection of your kernel’s **OI** and the roofline curve tells you what your performance ceiling is — and whether you’re bandwidth- or compute-limited.

###  Visualization

             /
            /   <-- Compute Roofline (FLOPs/sec)

- Kernels **below the roofline** are under-optimized.
- Move **up/right** by increasing data reuse or parallelism.

###  Optimization Paths

####  Memory-Bound Kernels

These are limited by bandwidth — they spend more time waiting on memory than doing useful computation.

 Strategies:
- **Improve memory coalescing**: Align memory access patterns across warps.
- **Use shared memory**: Temporarily cache data to reduce global memory loads.
- **Minimize transfers**: Avoid redundant memory reads/writes.
- **Prefetch memory**: Use `cudaMemPrefetchAsync()` for Unified Memory.

####  Compute-Bound Kernels

These are limited by ALU throughput — they max out the FP units before exhausting memory.

 Strategies:
- **Increase ILP**: Schedule multiple independent instructions to reduce stalls.
- **Reduce warp divergence**: Ensure uniform control flow across threads.
- **Loop unrolling**: Reduces instruction dispatch overhead and enables more aggressive compiler optimizations.
- **Use fast math**: `__fmul_rn`, `__fmaf_rn`, or even FP16/Tensor Cores when precision allows.


###  How to Use in Practice

1. Use `Nsight Compute` to calculate:
   - FLOPs executed
   - Bytes transferred from global memory
   - → Compute **Operational Intensity (OI)** = FLOPs / Bytes
2. Plot OI vs. achieved FLOPs/s and compare to GPU roofline.
3. Decide whether to optimize for memory or compute.


###  Why It Matters

The Roofline Model helps you:
- Avoid over-optimizing in the wrong dimension (e.g., tuning FP math when memory is the bottleneck)
- Target realistic performance ceilings
- Prioritize changes that **move your kernel upward** on the roofline chart


The Roofline Model gives CUDA developers **a clear, visual way to reason about performance limits**, especially when navigating complex trade-offs between memory and compute.



## 5.  Typical Optimization Strategies

Optimizing CUDA kernels involves tuning memory access patterns, thread efficiency, and instruction utilization. Below are common areas and techniques, along with rationale for each.

| Area               | Techniques & Explanation                                                                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Global Memory**  | - **Coalescing**: Ensure that consecutive threads access consecutive memory addresses to reduce transactions. <br> - **Avoid Strided Accesses**: Strides cause scattered loads, hurting performance. <br> - **Reuse via Shared Memory**: Reduce redundant global loads by staging frequently-used data into shared memory. |
| **Shared Memory**  | - **Tiling**: Load small chunks of global memory into shared memory to reuse across threads in a block (e.g., matrix multiply). <br> - **Avoid Bank Conflicts**: Shared memory is organized in 32 banks. Threads accessing the same bank cause serialization; pad arrays to avoid this. <br> - **Balance with Occupancy**: Shared memory use reduces threads/block; find a sweet spot. |
| **Register Usage** | - **Minimize Register Pressure**: Excessive register usage can lower occupancy by limiting the number of concurrent threads. <br> - **Use Compiler Flags**: Use `--ptxas-options=-v` or Nsight Compute to monitor register usage. <br> - **Manual Spilling**: Sometimes better to manually spill to shared memory instead of automatic spills to local memory. |
| **Warp Efficiency**| - **Avoid Divergence**: All threads in a warp execute the same instruction. Avoid `if/else` or loops with different trip counts across threads. <br> - **Warp-Level Primitives**: Use warp vote functions like `__all()`, `__any()`, or `__ballot_sync()` for efficiency over global syncs. |
| **Instruction Mix**| - **Use FP16 and Tensor Cores**: On GPUs with Tensor Core support (Volta and newer), use FP16/TF32 for deep learning or matrix-heavy workloads. <br> - **ILP (Instruction-Level Parallelism)**: Write kernels that have multiple independent instructions per thread to hide latency. <br> - **Fast Math Intrinsics**: Consider `__fmul_rn()` or `__fmaf_rn()` where precision allows to accelerate computation. |


###  Example: Optimizing a Matrix Multiplication Kernel

1. **Baseline**: Naive kernel loads all values from global memory.
2. **Step 1**: Use tiling and load sub-blocks into shared memory.
3. **Step 2**: Avoid bank conflicts using padded tiles (e.g., `tile[32][33]`).
4. **Step 3**: Unroll inner loops to reduce loop control overhead.
5. **Step 4**: Analyze occupancy and tune threads/block for your GPU.

Result: ~5–10x performance improvement compared to the naive version.


###  Final Tip

Always **measure before and after** applying changes using Nsight Compute or nvprof. Optimization should be data-driven, not guesswork.


## 6.  Occupancy Analysis

**Occupancy** refers to the ratio of **active warps per Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)** to the **maximum possible warps** on that architecture. It provides a rough measure of how effectively the GPU hardware is being utilized.

High occupancy generally improves performance by allowing the GPU to **hide memory latency** and maintain throughput — but **higher is not always better**.


###  API Usage

To estimate optimal configuration:

```cpp
int blockSize;   // Suggested threads per block
int minGridSize; // Minimum grid size to achieve full occupancy

cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize(&minGridSize, &blockSize, myKernel);
```

To calculate active blocks per SM given your parameters:

```cpp
int maxActiveBlocks;
cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor(&maxActiveBlocks, myKernel, threadsPerBlock, sharedMemPerBlock);
```

 Factors That Influence Occupancy
| Factor	| Description |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Threads per Block	| Larger blocks allow more warps but may exceed register or shared memory limits |
| Registers per Thread	| High register use may limit number of active warps |
| Shared Memory per Block	| Using too much shared memory reduces block concurrency |
| Warp Scheduling Limits	| SMs have hardware limits (e.g., 64 warps, 2048 threads, 16 blocks) |

 Common Pitfall
Too high occupancy may:
- Cause register spilling (to local/global memory)
- Increase contention for shared memory or caches
- Limit instruction-level parallelism (ILP)

 Best Practices
- Aim for balanced occupancy (50–80%) unless your kernel is extremely latency-bound.
- Use --ptxas-options=-v with nvcc to inspect register and shared memory usage:

nvcc -arch=sm_80 --ptxas-options=-v mykernel.cu

- Profile with Nsight Compute:
    - Look at Achieved Occupancy
    - Compare performance across different launch configurations

 Real-World Example
Matrix multiplication kernel:
- Initial config: 512 threads/block → High register usage → Only 2 blocks per SM.
- Tuning: Reduced threads to 256/block, reduced register pressure via compiler flags.
- Result: Occupancy improved from 37% to 75%, leading to a 2.1x speedup.

Occupancy is not the only factor that determines kernel performance, but it is a powerful lever to tune concurrency and throughput on the GPU.

## 7.  Kernel Launch Config Tuning

The configuration of your kernel launch — specifically the **grid** and **block** dimensions — has a significant impact on performance. CUDA does not auto-optimize launch parameters, so manual tuning is critical for peak efficiency.

---

###  Key Parameters

```cpp
kernel<<<numBlocks, threadsPerBlock>>>(...);
```

- `threadsPerBlock`: Controls how many threads run per block (typically 128–1024)
- `numBlocks`: Total number of blocks to launch = ceil(N / threadsPerBlock)

Choosing these wisely ensures full GPU utilization, optimal occupancy, and efficient memory access.

---

###  What to Experiment With

####  Varying Block Sizes

Try powers of two:
- 128 threads/block
- 256 threads/block (common sweet spot)
- 512 threads/block

 **Why it matters**:
- Impacts **occupancy** (how many warps/blocks can fit on an SM)
- Affects **coalescing patterns** in global memory
- Influences **register/shared memory pressure**

---

####  Tiling and Blocking

Use **tiling** in shared memory to divide data into reusable blocks.

Example:
```cpp
__shared__ float tileA[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];
__shared__ float tileB[TILE_SIZE][TILE_SIZE];

for (int k = 0; k < N/TILE_SIZE; ++k) {
  tileA[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[row][k * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.x];
  tileB[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[k * TILE_SIZE + threadIdx.y][col];
  __syncthreads();
  // multiply tiles
  __syncthreads();
}
```

 **Why it matters**:
- Greatly improves **data locality**
- Reduces **global memory traffic**
- Enhances **shared memory reuse**

---

####  Loop Unrolling

Manually unroll inner loops when loop trip count is fixed and small.

```cpp
#pragma unroll
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  sum += A[i] * B[i];
}
```

 **Why it matters**:
- Reduces loop control overhead
- Increases **Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP)**
- Gives compiler more opportunity to optimize

---

###  Best Practices

- Use **`cudaOccupancyMaxPotentialBlockSize()`** to get a good starting point.
- Start with 256 or 512 threads per block and tune from there.
- Measure performance changes using **Nsight Compute** (especially SM Efficiency, Warp Execution Efficiency, and DRAM Throughput).
- Align block sizes with warp size (32) to avoid under-utilized warps.

---

###  Example: Matrix Multiplication

| Config                    | SM Efficiency | Occupancy | Speedup |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| 1024 threads/block        | Low           | Low       | 1.0x    |
| 256 threads/block (tiled) | High          | High      | 3.8x    |
| 256 threads + unrolled    | Very High     | High      | 5.1x    |

---

Proper kernel launch tuning can turn a correct kernel into a **high-performance** one. It’s the bridge between working code and GPU-optimized code.


## 8.  Detecting Bottlenecks

Efficient CUDA performance requires identifying and addressing the **right bottleneck**. Profiling tools like **Nsight Compute** and **Nsight Systems** help correlate low-level metrics with performance issues.

---

###  Common Bottlenecks and Their Root Causes

| Symptom                 | Likely Cause                                                        |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Low SM Occupancy**    | - Excessive **register** or **shared memory** usage per thread/block <br> - Too few threads per block or grid-size mismatch |
| **High Memory Latency** | - **Poor memory coalescing** <br> - **Unaligned memory accesses** <br> - Relying too much on global memory instead of shared memory |
| **Warp Execution < 100%** | - **Branch divergence**: Threads in a warp follow different paths <br> - Uneven workload distribution |
| **L2 Cache Miss Rate High** | - Large working set exceeding cache capacity <br> - No **temporal or spatial locality** <br> - Ineffective data reuse patterns |

---

###  How to Detect

- Use **Nsight Compute** to monitor:
  - SM utilization
  - Warp execution efficiency
  - Global load efficiency
  - Cache hit rates

- Use **`--metrics`** with `nvprof` or `ncu`:
```bash
ncu --metrics sm__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed,dram__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed ./my_kernel
```

###  Actionable Tips
- Low Occupancy → Reduce register/shared mem usage or increase threads/block
- Memory Bottlenecks → Improve coalescing, leverage shared memory
- Warp Inefficiency → Restructure control flow to minimize divergence
- Cache Misses → Refactor for reuse or reduce working set size
